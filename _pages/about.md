# About Me

Hi! I'm currently a Quantitative Trader at SIG on their US Equity Options Desk in Chicago. I recently graduated from UChicago with a B.S. with Honors in Computational and Applied Mathematics (Machine Learning Specialization), a B.A in Statistics, and an M.S. in Computer Science. My Honors Thesis, "Mathematics of Leveraged ETFs, Beta Decay, and Long-Term Investment Viability" was advised by Professor Dylan Hall. My interests include effective altruism, film, meditation, personal fitness, political advocacy, and reading non-fiction.

Feel free to reach out!
