Hi! I'm currently a third-year undergraduate at the University of Chicago pursuing a Bachelor of Science with majors in Computational and Applied Mathematics (Honors), Data Science, and Statistics as well as the Four-Year Joint Master's (Bx/MS) in Computer Science. I’m involved with various quantitative finance and data science groups on campus. I have interests in effective altruism, political science, quantitative research, and trading.

Feel free to reach out!
