Hi! I'm currently a rising third-year undergraduate at the University of Chicago studying computational and applied mathematics, data science, and statistics. I am also plan on pursuing the four-year joint master's program (Bx/MS) in computer science. I’m involved with various quantitative finance and data science groups on campus. I have professional interests in trading, quantitative research, and data science.

Feel free to reach out!

Experience
------
**J.P. Morgan**, *Quantitative Research Strategist Intern (Received Return Offer)* <br />
In Summer 2022, I worked at J.P. Morgan as the sole undergraduate intern within the Securitized Products Group QR Strats team. In my role I supported trading and RSF Analytics and was trained on ABS, MBS, and S&T. I worked to develop a ‘GSE Arbitrage’ algorithm and UI in Python to analyze pricing differential between Agency versus Non-Agency MBS structuring. Additionally, I created a tool to identify structuring arb opportunities in the non-QM space by parsing and analyzing CDI data. I also implemented daily automated risk reports by codifying delta, DV01 rate scenario sensitivity, and max drawdown in Athena Studio.

**Bluebonnet Data**, *Data Science Fellow* <br />
From January through April 2021 I volunteered as a Political Data Science Fellow at Bluebonnet Data which is a nonprofit that recruits, trains, and organize students with skills in coding and data science to volunteer on data analyst teams for progressive down-ballet campaigns. Here, I utilized Python for political data analysis (VAN) to identify key demographics, predict voter turnout, and create targeted canvassing lists. I also created data visualizations to inform key insights that helped candidates more efficiently target voters’ interests.

**Finalyze Capital**, *Quantitative Analyst Intern* <br />
During Summer 2021 I worked at Finalyze Capital, which is a fully systematic quantitative CTA that is managed by UChicago alum Joe Fennessey and is co-owned / backed by Mark Cuban. Here, I parameterized and helped implement intraday momentum futures strategies, several of which had 1.5+ Sharpe Ratios. I sourced 10+ profitable strategies for their proprietary trading algorithm and outlined position entry code to backtest on the fund’s algorithm. I also researched machine learning algorithmic options / futures trading strategies and pitched strategy briefs directly to the CEO.

**Acrobator Ventures**, *Investment Data Analyst Intern* <br />
During Summer 2021 I also worked at Acrobator Ventures, which is a European VC fund focused on tech and data products. I prioritized a dynamic data set of incoming investment opportunities through their dead flow pipeline matching the fund’s scope. Similarly, I performed analysis on 25+ investment targets (market and competitive analysis, product, business plan, and valuation) and conducted final stage investment research / collaborated with Flow Traders on an OTC RFQ energy trading platform deal.
