Hi! I'm currently a third-year undergraduate at the University of Chicago studying computational and applied mathematics, data science, and statistics. I am also planning on pursuing the four-year joint master's program (Bx/MS) in computer science. I’m involved with various quantitative finance and data science groups on campus. I have professional interests in trading, quantitative research, and data science.

Feel free to reach out!
