Hi! I'm currently a rising fourth-year at UChicago majoring in Computational and Applied Math (Honors), Data Science, and Statistics, and am pursuing a Four-Year Joint Master's (BS/MS) in Computer Science. I'm also an incoming Quantitative Trader at SIG starting August 2024 on the US Equity Options Desk in Chicago. 

This upcoming school year, I will be writing my Honors Thesis titled "Mathematics of Leveraged ETFs, Beta Decay, and Long-Term Investment Viability". I’m also involved with various quant finance and data science groups on campus. My interests include effective altruism, film, personal fitness, and political advocacy.

Feel free to reach out!
