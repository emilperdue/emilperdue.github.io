Hi! I'm currently a second year undergraduate at the University of Chicago studying computational and applied mathematics, data science, and statistics. I am also interested in pursuing the four-year joint master's program (Bx/MS) in computer science. I’m involved with various quantitative finance and political science groups on campus.

I have professional interests in trading, quantitative research, and data science. This upcoming summer I will be working as a Quantitative Research Intern at J.P. Morgan within the Securitized Products Group.

Feel free to reach out!

Experience
------
**Bluebonnet Data**, *Data Science Fellow* <br />
From January through April I volunteered as a Political Data Science Fellow at Bluebonnet Data which is a nonprofit that recruits, trains, and organize students with skills in coding and data science to volunteer on data analyst teams for progressive down-ballet campaigns. Here, I utilized Python for political data analysis (VAN) to identify key demographics, predict voter turnout, and create targeted canvassing lists. I also created data visualizations to inform key insights that helped candidates more efficiently target voters’ interests.

**Finalyze Capital**, *Quantitative Analyst Intern* <br />
This past summer I worked for Finalyze Capital, which is a fully systematic quantitative CTA that is managed by UChicago alum Joe Fennessey and is co-owned / backed by Mark Cuban. Here, I parameterized and helped implement intraday momentum futures strategies, several of which had 1.5+ Sharpe Ratios. I sourced 10+ profitable strategies for their proprietary trading algorithm and outlined position entry code to backtest on the fund’s algorithm. I also researched machine learning algorithmic options / futures trading strategies and pitched strategy briefs directly to the CEO.

**Acrobator Ventures**, *Investment Data Analyst Intern* <br />
Last summer I also worked at Acrobator Ventures, which is a European VC fund focused on tech and data products. I prioritized a dynamic data set of incoming investment opportunities through their dead flow pipeline matching the fund’s scope. Similarly, I performed analysis on 25+ investment targets (market and competitive analysis, product, business plan, and valuation) and conducted final stage investment research / collaborated with Flow Traders on an OTC RFQ energy trading platform deal.
