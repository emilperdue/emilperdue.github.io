# About Me

Hi! I'm currently a fourth-year at UChicago majoring in Computational and Applied Math (Honors), Data Science, and Statistics, and am pursuing a Four-Year Joint Master's (BS/MS) in Computer Science. I'm also an incoming Quantitative Trader at SIG starting August 2024 on their US Equity Options Desk in Chicago. 

This school year, I will be writing my Honors Thesis titled "Mathematics of Leveraged ETFs, Beta Decay, and Long-Term Investment Viability". I’m also involved with various quant finance and data science groups on campus. My interests include effective altruism, film, meditation, personal fitness, political advocacy, and reading non-fiction.

Feel free to reach out!
