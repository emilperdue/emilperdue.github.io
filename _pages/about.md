I'm currently a second year undergraduate at the University of Chicago studying computational and applied mathematics, data science, and statistics. I’m involved with various quantitative finance and political science groups on campus.

I have professional interests in trading, quantitative research, and data science. This upcoming summer I will be working as a Quantitative Research Intern at J.P. Morgan in the Securitized Products Group.

Feel free to reach out!

Experience
------
**Bluebonnet Data**<br />
I am currently volunteering as a Political Data Science Fellow at Bluebonnet Data which is a nonprofit that recruits, trains, and organize students with skills in coding and data science to volunteer on data analyst teams for progressive down-ballet campaigns. Here, I am using Python for political data analysis (VAN) to identify key demographics, predict voter turnout, and create targeted canvassing lists. I am also in the process of creating data visualizations to inform key insights that help  candidates more efficiently target voters’ interests.

**Finalyze Capital**<br />
This past summer I worked for Finalyze Capital, which is a fully systematic quantitative CTA that is managed by UChicago alum Joe Fennessey and is co-owned / backed by Mark Cuban. Here, I parameterized and helped implement intraday momentum futures strategies, several of which had 1.5+ Sharpe Ratios. I sourced 10+ profitable strategies for their proprietary trading algorithm and outlined position entry code to backtest on the fund’s algorithm. I also researched machine learning algorithmic options / futures trading strategies and pitched strategy briefs directly to the CEO.

**Acrobator Ventures**<br />
Last summer I also worked at Acrobator Ventures, which is a European VC fund focused on tech and data products. I prioritized a dynamic data set of incoming investment opportunities through their dead flow pipeline matching the fund’s scope. Similarly, I performed analysis on 25+ investment targets (market and competitive analysis, product, business plan, and valuation) and conducted final stage investment research / collaborated with Flow Traders on an OTC RFQ energy trading platform deal.

Extracurriculars
------

**Maroon Capital & Derivatives Group Quant Trading**<br />
Currently undergoing an intensive training program in each quantitative finance RSO including weekly workshops and talks on derivatives and the theories of options pricing. I am in the process of developing/backtesting algorithmic trading strategies on historical data in order to maximize risk-adjusted returns in simulated trading environments.

**Oeconomica - Undergraduate Economics Research Group**<br />
Researcher in the Asset Pricing Cohort: Conducting alternative data-driven research on ESG stocks’ risk premium and the alpha potential in ESG-diversified portfolios.
